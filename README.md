# Walmart-Forecasting-Inventory-Project
This project develops an End-to-End Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization System for a multi-store retail network using Python. Leveraging Walmart’s real historical sales dataset, the system forecasts future demand, calculates optimal safety stock, determines reorder points, and identifies understocked stores requiring replenishment.
